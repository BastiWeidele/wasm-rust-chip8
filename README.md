# A WebAssembly CHIP-8 Emulator

A CHIP-8 emulator written in Rust and compiled to WebAssembly. Just for the fun of it!

## Building

This project uses the relatively new `wasm32-unknown-unknown` target, which can be enabled as per the [setup instructions](https://www.hellorust.com/setup/wasm-target/). Once installed simply run the `build` script.
